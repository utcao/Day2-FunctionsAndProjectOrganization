# Title: Organizing Project Repo Files into a Standard Subfolder Structure.

The goal of this exercise is to reorganize the files into a more-standard structure,
adding a new build file type called `pyproject.toml` to make it so that Python scripts can find the functions we make in this project, no matter what folder the scripts are stored in.

```

```


## Reference: A Minimal `pyproject.toml` File.

The `pyproject.toml` file contains installation instructions for Python projects, so that installing the functions is as simple as `pip install -e .`

Here is the absolute minimum needed for the project to work:
```
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "package_name"
version = "v0.0.1"
```

| **`Command`** | **`Description`** |
| :-- | :-- |
| `pip install -e .` | Install the packages and its dependencies into the current python environment, but keep it easy to modify the files. |
| `pip uninstall .` | Remove this package from the current python environment.  Note: won't uninstall the dependencies. |

## Instructions

1. Refactor Functions out to Modules: 
    1. ~~Move the functions you created in Exercise 1 to a module called `utils.py`, right next to the script.~~
    2. ~~Modify the script so that they import the functions from the module.~~
    3. ~~Make sure the script still runs.~~
    4. ~~Make a git commit to save the success.~~
2. Refactor the Project into the subfolders mentioned in the reference above.
    1. ~~Move the files into folders.~~
    2. The script should not work anymore, since the functions should be in `src/psth/` and the script should be in `scripts/`, making it hard for the script to find the functions.
    3. Write a minimal `pyproject.toml` file using the reference above and use it to install the `psth` package into the project. 
    4. Modify the script to import from `psth` to get the functions.  Now, the script should work again.
    5. Make a Git Commit to save the success.
